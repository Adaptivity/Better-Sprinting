Better Sprinting
================

## Source code license

The project is under the All Rights Reserved license, which means that redistribution is forbidden. However, I do not want to be as restrictive, so here are some general rules, and some specific cases for what you may want to do with the source.

1. Feel free to fork the project on GitHub. The repository must be publicly visible.
2. You are allowed to study the source code and learn from it, but don't just copy large portions of it into your project.
3. Official terms of use apply, thus you cannot redistribute any part of the mod or claim it as your own. Forking is the only exception to the redistribution rule.

### I want to use part of the mod in my own project

If you find something handy in the source code, I don't mind if you use it in your project (don't copy everything you see though, that's not how you learn to mod). Giving credit is only required if your project has publicly visible source, in that case use javadoc and link back to the original source.

### I want to modify something in Better Sprinting

It would be best to contact me first, because not everything can be added into the mod and I wouldn't want you to waste your time with a PR that will not get accepted.

When modifying the files, please try to follow my code formatting style. I don't autoformat because Eclipse doesn't let me customize the style exactly the way I want it, and for that reason I also cannot give you any preference file you could import.

I'm also a huge derp and don't really get how most of this Git thing works. Don't do anything big because if there's any problem accepting a PR, it will most likely not be accepted.

### I want to create an addon

Keep in mind that addons depend on the parent mod, but don't contain any part of it - otherwise it's a modification!

You are welcome to create and distribute any addon. If you let me know about it, I might add it to a list of supported addons too. :)

### I want to create a modification

The terms say that you cannot redistribute the mod or modifications of the mod. You can play around with the code if you fork the project, but if you want to distribute it, you need my explicit permission. I haven't been in this situation yet, so if you create a modification, let me know and we'll figure something out.
