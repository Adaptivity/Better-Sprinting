# Better Sprinting (Legacy)

This branch contains source codes of Better Sprinting for several very old versions of Minecraft (`1.2.5` to `1.7.2`).

These used to replace files from the original Minecraft `.jar` file, either by being installed directly into the `.jar` file, or via a Forge coremod.

* Each folder only contains the bare minimum, to avoid redistributing unnecessary vanilla source code files
* All modifications to vanilla source code are marked with comments that begin with `// CHANGE` or `/* CHANGE`
* Multiline modifications are also marked with an `// END` comment
* To compile each version, you need the [appropriate version of MCP](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Programs_and_editors/Mod_Coder_Pack#History)
