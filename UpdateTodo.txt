1. Update code
   - Search the repository for: // UPDATE
   - When mixed, custom code is marked // CUSTOM, vanilla code is marked // VANILLA
   - In methods that are inserted into vanilla code by the coremod, make sure code around insertion point hasn't changed, otherwise update coremod
   - Make sure all instances of vanilla code match the updated code, and check custom code for subtle changes
   - Once done, update the Minecraft version in the comment

2. Update version numbers
   - mcmod.info > version  -  mod version
   - BetterSprintingMod.buildId  -  unique build string for each release
   - BetterSprintingCore.supportedMinecraftVersion  -  Minecraft version

3. Make sure the mod is working
   - Test coremod
     - Make sure the coremod doesn't fail integrity check on startup
     - Test code in EntityPlayerSP.onLivingUpdate before and after the coremod insertion point
       - Easy way is to make sure a chest instantly closes while inside a portal in survival mode, and that horse jumping works, but that may change with an update
   - Test both SP and MP
     - Make sure all control options work
     - Test server-side commands with different locales
