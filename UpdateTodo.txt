1. Update code
   - Search the repository for: // UPDATE
   - When mixed, custom code is marked // CUSTOM, vanilla code is marked // VANILLA
   - In methods that are inserted into vanilla code by the coremod, make sure code around insertion point hasn't changed, otherwise update coremod
   - Make sure all instances of vanilla code match the updated code, and check custom code for subtle changes
   - Once done, update the Minecraft version in the comment

2. Update version numbers
   - mods.toml > version  -  mod version
   - BetterSprintingMod.buildId  -  unique build string for each release

3. Make sure the mod is working
   - Test coremod
     - Make sure the coremod doesn't fail integrity check on startup
     - Debug EntityPlayerSP.onLivingUpdate to make sure the control flow is still fine
       - 1. Put a breakpoint on the first line:
            > ++this.sprintingTicksLeft;
       - 2. Step over until this point:
            > boolean flag = this.movementInput.jump;
            > boolean flag1 = this.movementInput.sneak;
            > float f = 0.8F;
       - 3. Now step into these statements, and one of them will jump into the first line of LivingUpdate.injectOnLivingUpdate
       - 4. Step return, step over, and you should jump back to EntityPlayerSP on this line:
            > if (this.movementInput.jump && !flag && !this.onGround && this.motionY < 0.0D && !this.isElytraFlying() && !this.capabilities.isFlying)
       - 5. If any of these steps fail, things are bork
            (if the first breakpoint doesn't trigger, breakpoint into injectOnLivingUpdate, remove all breakpoints, step out, and go to step 1)
   - Test both SP and MP
     - Follow TESTING.md

4. Update version data
   - UpdateInfo.json
   - UpdateNotificationData.txt
